Features:
*add a menu entry in "MatrixFileReader" which outputs all datafolder and waves from the top dataview. This is intended as starting point for custom data manipulation.
*clone Graph copies now all waves from the new graph to a toplevel folder called clonedData. This servers as yet another starting point for data maniupluation by the user.
*add new preview panel popup menu selection mode named OnlyZ
*add new experiment template with both mfr gui and gpib control panel

-- Fixes --
Generic:
*proper alert message if the result file can not be reopened
*fix ordering of brickletlist in createDataWindowWithDFR
*rework cloned graph legend handling, fix it for arbitrary cuts and images
*Duplicate axis labels also for cloned graphs

Preview:
*show the spectroscopy source position in the previewpanel again
*fix not-so-nice display of non-rectangular data in the preview

Dataview1D:
*better wording for the no-originator-bricklet-found error message

Dataview2D:
*make cloned profile legend work again
*make the fft wave names shorter
*restore original graph magnification on undo
*copying image width and height settings didn't work for graphs in the fftpalen
*fix FFT Transformation, the normalization key from the wavenote was not up to date, therfore the transformation was wrong

Dataview 3D:
*be more permissive for finding grid spectroscopy originator bricklets
*fix labels for Z(V) Daten
*prevent processing multiple double clicks in the preview panel through a home-built blockreentry mechanism
*rename cloned data entries for the cuts again; now they are named the same as in the export popup menu
*Z(V) data; as in this case we also want to prescale the axes
*name the top and bottom cuts in a generic way for the clone menu 
*rework what we write into the wavenotes for 3D dataviews and especially for arbirtrary cuts
*interchange axis labels in spec const graph
*reverse trigger axis (Z or V) if the step width is negative
